https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Williams_%25R

Williams used a 10 trading day period and considered values below -80 as oversold and above -20 as overbought. But they were not to be traded directly, instead his rule to buy an oversold was

 %R reaches -100%.
Five trading days pass since -100% was last reached
 %R fall below -95% or -85%.

or conversely 

to sell an overbought condition %R reaches 0%.

Five trading days pass since 0% was last reached
 %R rise above -5% or -15%.

The timeframe can be changed for either more sensitive or smoother results. The more sensitive you make it, though, the more false signals you will get.


Code:

double calcPercentR(int n, collection daySummary)
{

  int n = 10;
  double percentR = 0, high = 0, low = 0;
  high = daySummary(0).high;
  low = daySummary(0).low;
  
  // Find the max and min stock price for the last n days
  for (int i = 1; i < n; i++)
  {
    if daysummary(i).high > high
      { high = daysummary.high(i);}
    if daysummary(i).low < low
      { low = daysummary.low(i);}
  }  

  // Calculate the %R 
  // Note: daySummary.close(0) is the close price for today

  
  percentR = (high-daySummary.close(0))/(high-low)*(-100);

  return(percentR);
